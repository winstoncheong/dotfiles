I want the majority of these files to be frozen.
Very little tweaking should be needed.

The exception should be \texttt{winstonMathMacros.tex} and
\texttt{winstonOtherMacros.tex}.
It is reasonable for these two to change, as I come up with reasonable macros that can be used in all of my note files.

Theorem setup may be finicky. For some files, may need to copy contents into the
specific file, and adjust from there.



Using this reintroduces dependencies. I have to be careful not to break things.
